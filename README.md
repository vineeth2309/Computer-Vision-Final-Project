# Computer-Vision-Final-Project
Code submission for Computer Vision Final Project

To Run 2D segmentation:

    1) Run Q1_Kmeans.m   
    2) Run Q1_thresh.m   

To Run 3D segmentation:

    1) Run Q3_Kmeans.m   
    2) Run Q3_thresh.m   

To Run Additional Methods:

    1) Run additional_implementations/FuzzyCMeans.m

    
    2) Deep Learning Approach:

        a) To train the model, set the flag train=True, and flag test = False

        b) To test and evaluate the model, set the flag train=False, and flag test=True
